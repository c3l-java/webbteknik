	// 1)  Have a look at blocket and create a single object that you think contains all the properties
	//  needed to represent an item on blocket.
	//Title
	//Category
	//Description
	//Images
	//Price
	//Location
	var blocketItem = {};
	blocketItem.title = "4 kittens";
	blocketItem.category = "Animals";
	blocketItem.images = ["cat1.jpg", "cat2.jpg"];
	blocketItem.description = "4 lovely kitten for sale";
	blocketItem.price = 400;
	blocketItem.location = "734931";

	
	// 2) As you will be making lots of these objects and want to minimise the risk of errors. Create an
	// object factory function. A function that takes the values and returns a populated floggit object.
	
	var blocketItemFactory = function(title, category, images, description, price, location){
		var that = {};
		that.title = title;
		that.category = category;
		that.images = images;
		that.description = description;
		that.price = price;
		that.location = location;
		return that;
	};
	
	// 3) Create an array with multiple floggit objects in it.
	var blocketItems = [], i;
	blocketItems.push(blocketItemFactory("kittens", "Animals", ["img1.jpg","img2.jpg"],"pretty cats",500,"73994"));
	blocketItems.push(blocketItemFactory("Wheels", "Car parts"));
	blocketItems.push(blocketItemFactory("kittens 2", "Animals"));
	blocketItems.push(blocketItemFactory("kittens 3", "Animals"));

	// 4)  Your boss wants to see if your structure is going to work for the list all objects. Create a loop 
	// that loops through all your objects and console.logs just the titles.
	for(i = 0; i < blocketItems.length; i = i + 1){
		console.log(blocketItems[i].title);
	}
	// 5) Advanced can you sort your array by the object price and rerun the loop you created in step 4?
